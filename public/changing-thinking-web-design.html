And then have a look at any local newspaper, although different, the inherent way of consuming the content solely relies on the user's vision going downwards as if the entire webpage was just a fancy article.</p> <p>This way of designing doesn't take into account the newfound possibilities technologies such as WebGL brings us, nor is user interaction and engagement a part of the design. Yes, microinteractions are common on so-called &quot;normcore&quot; sites, but a pulsing button to read more or a &quot;like&quot; button isn't going to be what's ultimately engaging the user and creating a fun experience.</p> <p>Turning our websites into web experiences requires us to look at the fundemental ways humans sense and percieve the world around us and incorporate the clues from this into the digital experiences. Such may be the usage of the Z-axis in scroll, and not just X and Y, adding a bridge with the real world through AR and use the user's surroundings as part of the experience, using the client's product (the concept of time, process and the pouring motion for a wine for example) or using user input through various means (trackpad, keyboard, webcam etc.) to modify the page in a way that is intuitive.</p> <p>The concept of intuition used here I must precise is intuition received through interactions with nature and physical objects in the real world, and not intutions exposure to flat 2D websites has given us.</p> <p>This way of thinking about design does however have its drawbacks and is not applicable to all forms of websites either. As you may see on this blog, the design is purely flat and minimal with very little usage of the above mentioned principles. And honestly, it probably wouldn't have been a good reading experience if there were a thousand things happening in the background and as you moved your cursor or scrolled. The good use cases are up to each designer to evaluate on where applying this way of thinking may actually contribute to the experience and be fit for the client.</p> <p>There is also the aspect of performance and how we look at the consumerist economy. Because increased usage of expensive effects will result in people replacing their hardware more frequently as websites demand more and more. Here again, looking at the context is important; a campaign for an art gallery will have to be treated differently than the main site of the national tax bureau for example.
